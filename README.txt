Welcome to my Hangman Game made in Python!

This is a simple program that allows a user to interact with a GUI
and play a game of hangman.

This program implements tkinter, random, and time to run the game.

tkinter, time is used for the GUI purposes in the file hangmanCodeGUI
random is used for the game logic purpose in the class hangmanCodeFunctions

hangmanCodeGUI is a file that creates an inteactive
GUI frame that allows a user to play the game Hangman. This GUI recieves data
and creates a hangmanCodeFunctions object to run the logic for the game. To run this program tkinter,
ttk, and hangmanCodeFunctions is required.

hangmanCodeFunctions is a class that allows
users to call and create this hangman game object. This allows the
GUI class to transfer and recieve data and process the logic
for the actualy hangman game. This class already has a 
pre-existing word bank dictionary file of 61,330+ words (bagofworrds.txt)

To run this program run hangmanCodeGUI which will start the game on a GUI application.
